        <h3>Quality Assurance</h3>
        <p>We’re car lovers just like you. We know that your vehicle is more than just transportation. That’s why we put the same level of care into crafting our seat covers as you do into maintaining your car. We strive for perfection in every detail, ensuring a flawless result every time.</p>
        <p>At DIY Auto Upholstery, we take pride in delivering <strong>superior quality seat covers</strong> that match or exceed OEM standards. We source only the finest <strong>automotive-grade upholstery materials</strong> from top suppliers to ensure <strong>durability, comfort, and a perfect fit</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>Our <strong>genuine leather</strong> is carefully selected from leading suppliers in the USA and Brazil. We use thick <strong>top-grain leather</strong>, processed for <strong>UV resistance and long-lasting durability</strong>, preventing cracking, peeling, or fading over time. Unlike low-quality alternatives, our leather retains its <strong>original factory color</strong>—we never use dyes or artificial coatings.</p>
        
        <p>For customers preferring <strong>synthetic leather</strong>, we use premium-grade materials sourced from reputable USA manufacturers, adhering to <strong>strict quality and environmental standards</strong>. Every seat cover is backed with a <strong>1/4-inch thick foam padding</strong>, enhancing both comfort and durability.</p>
        
        <p>Each cover is <strong>handcrafted and individually tested</strong> for fitment before being packed and shipped from our <strong>Houston, USA factory</strong>. We stand behind our work with a <strong>100% money-back guarantee</strong>—because quality isn't just a promise, it's our commitment.</p>

        <h3>Important Notes</h3>
        <p><strong style="color:#b8860b;">DIY Instructions:</strong> We recommend installation by a professional. But many of our customers choose to change the seat covers themselves. We are happy to send you our <strong style="color:#000000;">General Installation Guidelines</strong>. Please note, the installation process may vary based on car make and model.</p>
        
        <p><strong style="color:#b8860b;">Replacement Cover:</strong> Please note that this seat cover replaces your old cover. This is not a slip-on or pullover cover. You have to remove your old seat cover first.</p>
        
        <p><strong style="color:#b8860b;">Heating Element:</strong> Depending on your make and model, you may need to transfer the heating element. If the seat cover you purchase has an aftermarket heating element attached to the seat cover, you will need to transfer the connector from your old cover to the new heating element. Get in touch if you are unsure.</p>
        
        <p><strong style="color:#b8860b;">Airbag Components:</strong> These are not included and need to be transferred from the original cover where applicable.</p>
        
        <p><strong style="color:#b8860b;">Foam and Frame:</strong> These parts are not included.</p>
        
        <p><strong style="color:#b8860b;">Attachment Clips:</strong> The attachment clips may be different than the original and may require a 180-degree flip to install.</p>
        
        <p><strong style="color:#b8860b;">Cuts for Power/Air Bag:</strong> Due to several options available for different models, we do not pre-cut any holes for power buttons, headrests, seatbelts, air bags, etc. These cuts are to be made at the time of installation and it is fairly easy to do.</p>

        <h4 style="color:#b8860b; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Fit & Compatibility</h4>
        <p><strong>Q: How do I know if this seat cover will fit my vehicle?</strong><br>
        A: We’re happy to help! Please send us a message with photos of your seats and the VIN sticker. Also, let us know which seat covers you need to replace (driver, passenger, top, bottom, rear, etc.).</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: Do your seat covers fit all original seat features?</strong><br>
        A: Yes, our covers are precisely designed to accommodate all standard seat features, including adjustable controls, thigh supports, and heating elements.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: Are your seat covers airbag compatible?</strong><br>
        A: Yes, our seat covers are designed to be airbag-compatible. However, the airbag components must be transferred during installation. We recommend having them installed by a professional automotive upholstery shop to ensure safety and functionality.</p>
        
        <h4 style="color:#b8860b; font-size: 20px;">Material & Customization</h4>
        <p><strong>Q: How are your seat covers different from the original ones?</strong><br>
        A: Each of our seat covers is meticulously crafted to match your original cover in both fit and appearance. We source top-quality upholstery materials from the largest suppliers worldwide to ensure durability and comfort.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: How do you ensure the seat cover color and stitching match my car?</strong><br>
        A: We source auto upholstery materials with original factory colors from the best manufacturers. To ensure a perfect match, we may ask for photos of your seats and the VIN sticker. This helps us create your seat cover with an exact match in material, color, stitching, and perforation.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: I need a seat cover with or without perforation. Is this available?</strong><br>
        A: Yes! Seat covers for some car models are available in both perforated and non-perforated styles. To ensure we provide the correct design, we may request photos of your seats and the VIN sticker. This allows us to confirm the right color, fit, perforation, and stitching for your vehicle.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: My seat covers are a different material or color. Do you have this?</strong><br>
        A: We offer seat covers in multiple variations for most models, including different colors and materials like genuine leather, synthetic leather, cloth (fabric), and Alcantara. If you can’t find your model or need assistance, please contact us—we’re happy to help!</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: My original seat covers are synthetic leather. Can I get genuine leather replacements?</strong><br>
        A: Yes, for most seat covers, we offer the option of genuine leather. Please contact us for details.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: Can I customize the color and material of my seat covers?</strong><br>
        A: While we specialize in OEM-style replacement seat covers, we do offer custom options for most models. Contact us to discuss your needs. Please note that customized orders are final and non-returnable.</p>
        
        <h4 style="color:#b8860b; font-size: 20px;">Installation & Fitment</h4>
        <p><strong>Q: Do your seat covers come with foam cushions and frames?</strong><br>
        A: No. You will need to remove your old seat cover from the original foam cushion and frame and replace it with the new one we provide.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: Can I install the seat covers myself?</strong><br>
        A: We recommend professional installation for the best fit. However, if you have the right tools and experience with similar DIY projects, you can install them yourself. Patience and proper equipment are key to a successful installation.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: Where can I have my seat covers installed?</strong><br>
        A: Installation can be done at any professional auto upholstery shop.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: I can’t attach the cover to the frame because the clip is stitched backward.</strong><br>
        A: The clip needs to be turned or folded inward 180 degrees to attach properly to the metal frame.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: The covers I received don’t have pre-cut openings for the headrests or armrests.</strong><br>
        A: Due to the many seat variations available, we do not pre-cut openings for power buttons, headrests, seatbelts, or airbags. These cuts should be made during installation to ensure a proper fit.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: The heating element connector is different from my original.</strong><br>
        A: Heating elements have different connectors depending on the model. You will need to transfer your original connector to the new heater. Contact us if you need instructions.</p>
        
        <h4 style="color:#b8860b; font-size: 20px;">Shipping, Tracking & Warranty</h4>
        <p><strong>Q: How fast can I receive my seat cover? Do you offer expedited shipping?</strong><br>
